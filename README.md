# Case Study : Analyzing Job Market Data in Tableau

## Problem to solve
You will be working for an employer recruiting firm, called DataSearch, to find insights into market trends of jobs in data science. Recruiters, also known as headhunters, perform employment recruiting services for both companies and those looking to gain employment. You'll be tasked to use a dataset of job postings to find trends in top data science jobs along with associated skills.

- Dataset : a fictitious dataset that is comprised of job postings over the past 5 years for the Data and Analytics industry. Each entry in the table of this dataset correlates to a specific job posting in time, which has 19 attributes or columns for each posting.
- Task : discover trends in jobs and skills within the data  science

key findings
1. the number of job postings are trending upward over time. With the exception of a couple of brief periods of decline in job postings in 2020; overall, job postings for data science roles are rising in demand, which is a very good thing for DataSearch. 
2. there are 5 jobs to investigate, Data Engineers, Scientists, and Analysts are some of the most in demand jobs. We will want to focus on these jobs in our upcoming analysis to maximize our efforts.
3. we noted that various industries are requesting data science and engineer positions very frequently and that these roles all have competitive salaries that are rising with demand.
